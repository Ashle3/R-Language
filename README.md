# R Language

# Overview

Data analysis is a subject I am curious about as a software engineer. While reading up on data analysis, I learned that the R language is widely used when it comes to data analysis. In order to expand my knowledge in as many programming languages as possible, and looking to learn more about data analysis, I thought it would be important to learn the R language.

My software consists of many files, each of them letting me practice with all of the different R data types (numeric, integer, complex, character, and boolean), as well as basic R syntax such as printing, looping, data frames, or reading from a csv file.

My purpose for writing this software is to become more familiar with the basics of the R programming language,especially if I am interested in data analysis.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VSCode to edit the code in my software, as well as Microsoft Excel, to write my CSV file, and the R language, which I downloaded onto my device from the internet.

The programming language I used for this project is R, which is mainly used in data analysis.

# Future Work

- Create a program that is more cohesive (i.e. it has a purpose and isn't broken up into so many files)
- Analyze bigger sets of data
- Create more varied graphs to help visualize data
